Question 4 :

A) Commands to observe or troubleshoot
->
1. vmstat -w will show you overeem (processes, swap, mem, cpu, io, system)

2. pmstat -P ALL will provide you statistics (with %iowait) per cpu core

3. iostat -x look for high %util or long await or big average queue size

4. dig deeper with iotop

5. ps -ax look for state D which is uninterruptible sleep (usually IO), run it one more time check if they are still in D state

6. sar -b - overall io activities
   sar -d - individual block device io activities

B) Top Processes that are consuming more load on server :
->
Linux ( Sort by Memory ):
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head

htop command can also be used.


C) Minimise the server load/ slow apache services
->
I Will check teh process and kill the process with sleeping state.

ps -ef | grep sleep

// will list all the process that are in sleep

930936265 12237 90819   0  6:48PM ttys001    0:00.00 grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn sleep

// Now kill those process
kill -9 12237 

Other tips to reduce server load :
1. Optimize your images
2. Compress your CSS
3. Compress your data
4. Host your images elsewhere
